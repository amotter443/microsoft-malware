> Binomial classification algorithm to predict whether Windows devices contain malware 


The leader in first place had an ROC score of 0.67585, whereas our logistic model 
(within the private leaderboard) had an ROC of 0.67667. -This put us in a position to qualify for the prize winning money as 1st of almost 2500 teams of professional data scientists. 


About The Project
-----------------------
83 features (see Data Dictionary)
17.6 million observations
Logistic regression, SVM, NB, RF, GB, ensemble


A Few Clarifications
-----------------------
- Given the performance limitations of the R Server (discussed in greater detail in the next section) the training and test pre-processing are done in separate scripts. The methdology and process is almost identical in each
- In the cleaning script's 2nd sections, the categorical features are converted into numeric in order by percentage of malware in the group. Each of these sections was commented out and should have been reusably created as a function, so please uncomment before running the cleaning script
- Many of the features in the dataset are inherently unintuative to someone without a working knowledge of computer hardware specifications. For a more complete data dictionary, please consult the attached one as the Kaggle dictionary does not explain several key features 
- This script was written in the spring of my junior year of undergrad, and given the many performance limitations efficiency of server computing was prioritized over scripting efficiency. While I hope to revisit and revise the scripts in the future, there are many areas of improvement in terms of the code's elegence 


R Server Interaction
-----------------------
- 5GB in total, too large to open in Excel
- Challenges dealing with server environment ( was using 55GB of memory to run NN)
- Option to use csv subset if no distributed access 


Unique Insights
-----------------------
- Users who were infected with malware typically had more than one security/anti-
virus application installed, which led us to infer that they were not as technology savvy as other users. 
- Similar insight with ExistsNotSet
- Gamers had a statistically lower infection rate, has to due with price of equipment and general tech knowledge of hobby
